[Deliverable 2](https://github.com/jzebker/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Pyber_fare_summary.png)

## Overview
Using python and pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type **and** a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  In addition, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
## Results

|  | Total Rides | Total Drivers | Total Fares | Average Fares | Average Fare per Driver |
|------------:|--------------:|------------:|--------------:|------------------------:|--------:|
|       Rural |           125 |          78 |     $4,327.93 |                  $34.62 | $55.49 |

(1) **Total Rides -** PyBer was most frequently used in **Urban** cities.  Almost 70% of total rides were in urban cities.

(2) **Total Drivers -** Over 80% of the drivers operated in **Urban** cities.  Only about 16% and about 3% were in suburban and rural cities respectively.

(3) **Total Fares -** Over 60% of the total fares during the time period observed were generated in **Urban** cities.  About 30% and about 7% were generated in suburban and rural cities respectively.

(4) **Average Fares -** The average fare per ride was lowest in **Urban** cities and highest in **Rural** cities.

(5) **Average Fare per Driver -**  The average fare per driver was much lower in **Urban** cities when compared to both **Rural** and **Suburban** cities.  It is less than half and less than a third of the average fare per driver in suburban and rural cities respectively.

(6) **Total Weekly Fares -** Per the graph above, total weekly fares remained fairly constant throughout the time period observed.  They were consistently higher in **Urban** cities vs either rural or suburban cities.  The above graph does not contain data for the last week listed in the data because it was not a full week.

## Summary
Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
