## Overview
Using python and pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type **and** a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  In addition, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
