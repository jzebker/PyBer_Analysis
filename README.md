[Deliverable 2](https://github.com/jzebker/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Pyber_fare_summary.png)

## Overview
Using python and pandas, create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type **and** a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.  In addition, submit a written report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.
## Results
There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type.
